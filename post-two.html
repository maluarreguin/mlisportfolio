I approached this project as a form of exploration rather than definitives, as I feel as though I lack the histoical knowledge to make longstanding claims from my one dataset. However, the dataset is incredibly thorough, and does an excellent job at structuring and organizing these cases into the greater context of the witchcraft trials at the time. Further, I believe what we can grasp from the data I have utilized for this project is what this smaller subsection highlights about this period at large.</p><p>As is made plain upon scannning the website, the majority of these cases involve women, and the percentage of cases involving fairies is miniscule in the survey as a whole. Seperatley, as can be found in amoungst these other areas in the Data Visualizations tab, we can see that a majority, by far, of these cases involving fairies come about at the turn of the century, with 1697 and 1597 sitting in first and third places, respectively. While this is something that could be easily overlooked, I found this detail to be fascinating, as to me, it emphasizes the notion of the conciousness of time impacting the thoughts, actions, and behaivors of its people. In a class I took in undergrad at UC Berkeley, we studied the Victorian novel at the turn of the nineteenth century, and uncovered that, within these texts as an example, human behavior becomes more hysterical and and is less characterized by order and societal standards. Seeing as the belief and action of engaging with fairies is an excellent example of going against the religious values of the time, and further was punishable by death, I feel as though this small detail could be utilzied as evidence of time periods dictating the behaivors of its societies. </p><p>In this project, The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft Database is predominantly used while in conjunction with several essays, journals, books, and articles that expanded upon and provided me with greater context of the discourse of fairies in Scottish witchcraft at large. The project provides data visulations made through Excel and and a map created through Tableau. The header art for the website is titled, 'Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing' and was originally painted by William Blake in 1789. This website was created using Publii and is being hosted on GitHub. </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Malu Arreguin | UCLA | maluarreguin@g.ucla.edu</p><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><img style="border-width: 0;" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png" alt="Creative Commons License"></a><br>This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://maluarreguin.github.io/mlisportfolio/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://maluarreguin.github.io/mlisportfolio/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
