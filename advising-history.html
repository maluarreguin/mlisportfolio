Unfortunately, Professor Furner was out of office due to a sickness during that time. Instead, I messaged Dee Winn on March 11, 2022, regarding who to reach out to regarding my questions. I was directed to either her, Michelle Maye, or Dr. Michelle Caswell depending on the nature of my questions. I subsequently did not message anyone, and later heard back from Furner when he returned from his sick leave.</p><p><u>September 7, 2022</u>: Email sent to Professor Furner to get a signature on the internship form for that quarter, which I ultimately did not end up using my internship for course credit then due to a class conflict.</p><p><u>October 18, 2022</u>: Email sent to Professor Furner regarding some confusion I had about the nature of the issue statement and paper portion of the portfolio.</p><p><u>September 22, 2022, to January 9, 2023</u>: Email sent to Professor Furner asking if I could use my English 203 course to count towards my research methods requirements for my MLIS degree. Professor Furner approved of this change and the form was properly signed and sent to Michelle Maye in early January of 2023 after I had successfully completed the course.</p><p><u>January 19, 2023, to February 6, 2023</u>: Professor Furner sent an email to me asking if I would like to set up a meeting soon to go over any potential questions regarding my progress towards my MLIS. I agreed and we set up a Zoom meeting for February 6, 2023. In the meeting Professor Furner went over my list of courses and approved of my plan for Spring quarter and that I was on the appropriate track for graduation.</p><p><u>February 2, 2023</u>: Email sent to Professor Furner to get my intent to present form signed and submitted to Michelle Maye.</p><p><u>April 3, 2023</u>: Email sent to Professor Furner to get a signature on the internship form for that quarter; I did enroll in the internship course.</p><p><u>April 4, 2023</u>: Email sent to Professor Furner with my finalized spring course schedule to ensure everything looked appropriate for spring graduation, units wise. Professor Furner approved of it accordingly.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Malu Arreguin | UCLA | maluarreguin@g.ucla.edu</p><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><img style="border-width: 0;" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png" alt="Creative Commons License"></a><br>This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://maluarreguin.github.io/mlisportfolio/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://maluarreguin.github.io/mlisportfolio/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
