The intention for this is to establish greater ease of accessibility for scholars around the world and the public at large. The collection of Oscar Wilde assets at The Clark is the most prolific in the world and the initiative to integrate these items into an online source will greatly contribute to Oscar Wilde’s influence and the preservation of these rare materials. The collection incorporates rare books, manuscripts, and iconographies. The intended users of this soon to be digital archive are scholars of Wilde, 19<sup>th</sup> century literature and history, and patrons that are interested in discovering a greater context of information regarding this prominent literary and historical figure. Further, while the digital archive will be accessible for all regardless of circumstances, we presume that given our reputation as a Special Collections Research Library that principal users will be undergraduate and graduate students conducting primary research through our source database. As an example of this, we will create our own case. For this, we will introduce Celeste, a PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley who is focusing on 19<sup>th</sup> century literature and is writing her dissertation on the philosophies of the Aesthetic Movement in the Victorian Era and its historical impact. As Wilde is a significant figure in these corresponding movements, she believes that conducting research that incorporates iconographies of Wilde alongside his original manuscript notes would be useful in the development of her dissertation. Now, as this scholar lives in Berkeley which is approximately an eight-hour drive away from The Clark, by creating this digital repository, we are allowing her to conduct her research—or at least begin to—without having to travel a substantial distance. Further, due to the influx of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have all learned that circumstances can arise without warning that can dictate users’ abilities to physically interact with original source materials. Through establishing this online digital archive, we are creating both a long-term digital preservation plan for The Clark’s collections and furthering the efforts of the dissemination of information to all.</p><p>Here at The Clark, it is our hope that through collaborative efforts this digital archive will culminate in an effectively constructed site that showcases both electronic editing and digital representation. Through the implementation of these design principles the archive will be able to advance the development of other editions, catalogues, databases, and scholarly tools into one prominent electronic archival resource. It is our ambition to extend these efforts to create faithful digitized reproductions of rare and original materials in both detail and scale. For this, we intend to have pieces published through both a ‘preview mode’ and a ‘standard mode’ on the website. For books that have been fully published we will strive to provide a wealth of contextual information including full and accurate bibliographical details and meticulous descriptions of the content found within each digitized image. Users of the archive will be able to attain a new degree of access to these pieces through the combination of both advanced text and image-searching tools that are made possible by our editors-controlled vocabulary, detailed image descriptions, and innovative software. As previously stated, for this long-term project we will be implementing controlled vocabularies to allow for ease of text and image searching when users interact with the digital collection. For this project our intention is to establish a local vocabulary to thoroughly detail the specific efforts of this endeavor. Moreover, the archive will be built under the presumption of a considerable allowance for future enhancements in both hardware and software.</p><p>As stated in Miller’s piece ‘Introduction to Metadata for Digital Collections’, the efforts of this endeavor are to, in essence, publish a digital collection, which Miller refers to as, “a collection of digital resources, along with the metadata about those resources, made available online through an interface that allows users to search and or browse the contents of that collection.” (Miller) For this undertaking within the digital archive, our intention is for each asset to contain textual metadata that includes the entire image information record. In turn, these textual records are designed to be a part of the archive's image files. From here, the hope is for these information records to combine the technical data recorded alongside additional bibliographic documentation, as well as information pertaining to provenance, present location, and the institution. It is our intention for these image files to contain several different kinds of information beyond the image themselves and that inserting these image information records into the portion of the image file reserved for textual metadata that this integration will allow the record to move with the image, even if it were to be downloaded and separated from the digital archive.</p><p>Further, within this project the metadata standard we will be using throughout this collection will be TEI which will be encoded using XML. We chose to utilize TEI—the 'text encoding imitative’—for this because we feel that it is both the most prominent and powerful tool for creating metadata for humanities documents. In addition, as this project is formulated through a digitizing initiative corresponding to a physical special collection, this allows TEI to be an excellent method to represent the textual features of these objects for research purposes in both a direct and succinct format. TEI will also provide a simple foundation for researchers to make use of without the necessity of special-purpose software and permits for a rigorous definition and processing of texts. TEI can also provide for user-defined extensions and further conform to both existing and emergent standards. As TEI exclusively uses XML to encode textual data, this will in turn allow data to remain usable even as platforms and file formats develop with time. Our efforts stand on the premise of looking beyond what we are currently trying to accomplish with this initiative and lie in the desire to create a digital archive for the present moment that will be able to evolve alongside the passage of time—similar to the literature, celebrity and renown of Wilde. To contextualize XML, we would indicate italics with a plain ASCII tag. Further, XML does not have to be purely descriptive and can permit us to both recognize and encode the structure of documents through a title or heading that can be tagged and described.</p><p>A set of XML tags designed for a specific purpose will be referred to as a Document Type Definition, or DTD, which will establish a hierarchical system of contexts and constraints to allow for its tags to be used in the creation of consistent document structures. The hope is for our institution to utilize several Document Type Definitions for the project to further encode each asset at both the object and collection level as well as to incorporate and encode the textual metadata that constitutes the image information record as we have previously mentioned.</p><p>Upon competition of the website, our intention is for users to alternate between two modes, namely ‘gallery mode’ and ‘reading mode’. Both modes will provide a separate viewing experience for the user with ‘gallery mode’ being labeled as the default site setting that will showcase numerous digitized copies without the inclusion of text on the ‘object view’ page. Within the ‘object view’ page, a set of tools will be incorporated for each image; these instructions will include rotate, zoom, enlargement, transcription, and citation in our initial publishing of the site. Within the ‘gallery’ window, we plan to provide an ‘information box’ which we aim to be a critical apparatus for the copy where a user can view the textual transcription, image description, and editors' notes for the object being observed. At the bottom half of the ‘object view’ page, we plan to provide a subset of the following tabs pertinent to what is being viewed. These could include ‘copy and group’, ‘same matrix’, ‘textually referenced’, and ‘letter information’ to name a few. Seeing as the digital assets in this collection are inherently related to one another due to the nature of this special collection, we plan to incorporate a tab for user comparison of these relationships where an individual can select objects for comparison that will then place these digitized assets side-by-side, similar in practice to that of ‘gallery mode’. Within this ‘compare’ window, information will be highlighted to correspond with the original object in the ‘gallery’ window. In ‘reading mode’, copies of works will be displayed as a horizontally scrollable window that will contain the objects of the copy in sequence with their respective textual transcriptions and without the use of a supporting instrument for website navigation.</p><p>Regarding the enhancement of metadata, during the initial procedures of the project the intention is for the metadata enrichment to be a closed effort confined within the staff of The Clark Library. However, upon the completion of this initial web-publishing, the implementation of either metadata enhancement through such sources as crowdsourcing or machine learning could potentially be implemented. When envisioning these future options, we at The Clark have imagined the pros and cons to both options and see the inherent value each could offer our program. As it stands currently, it seems that the efforts of crowdsourcing would be the more inclusive option, especially as the collection grows and the introduction of others to offer new methods that were previously untapped begin to emerge. Further, the continuous development of this digital repository will be motivated in part by responding to the needs of a dispersed and varied audience of readers and viewers. Yet, due to the nature of the original publishing of assets being regarded under our special collections category, it is possible a machine learning enhancement tool could potentially accomplish tasks quicker and more thoroughly than a human in future years. However, we do not have an answer to that question yet, but we are certain that with time, and as the collection and digital archive evolve, we will identify the answers to these matters.</p><p>In conference with Whalen’s piece regarding rights metadata, there are several key factors to note as we create this digital archive. First, although these articles in this collection confer with the rights of Oscar Wilde, his works are in fact in the public domain as he died at the at the end of the nineteenth century. However, while it would be easy to look past this area due to this key fact, we at The Clark believe that the establishment of this digital archive should promote the efforts of information dissemination and descriptive metadata standards, and thus, are planning on incorporating rights metadata in this effort through the same practice implemented at the Getty Research Institution, as Whalen’s piece notes. This effort will involve the enactment of a specific rights metadata dictionary for our special collection as we are confident these actions will promote further developments in the foreseeable future. As stated in the piece, Whalen discusses that, “[…] two important improvements came from this […] clarification of which work was being described in the record, and the addition of terms to the drop-down menus that allow users to better understand some of the ambiguities or unknowns about the rights information provided.” (Whalen)</p><p>Upholding the data quality of our assets has been and will continue to be a longstanding goal in our efforts of providing reliable description and access to our special collections’ materials. While numerous variables can contribute to data quality issues, we at The Clark feel confident that we will be able to appropriately address these issues in a manageable format if and when they were to arise. As our task stands of transforming and enriching data from our current records into a machine-readable format for the purposes of this digital archive, we understand that these efforts will need to be thoroughly scrutinized to ensure consistencies across databases. With the onset of our plans, we hope to reestablish core metadata fields in our data, reestablish content rules across our data models, provide metadata enrichment, and integrate preservation metadata during digitization. All of these efforts have the potential to incur metadata quality issues, and the impacts of these matters can affect the overall usability of our online digital archive. From inconsistent recall and precision to data ambiguity, small miscalculations have the potential to lead to a culminative loss of trust from users in our digital archive and our institution as whole. In establishing and upholding quality metrics in our project we will be able to create the digital archive we believe is needed for the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Further, we will be following the quality metric values presented in ‘The Continuum of Metadata Quality: Defining, Expressing, Exploiting’, which includes completeness, accuracy, consistency, appropriateness, provenance, timeliness, and accessibility. (Bruce and Hillmann) At length, the effort of foreseeing potential data quality issues alongside resource description issues are matters we have been considering throughout this process and will continue to do so as our needs and obligations transform over time.</p><p class="align-center">Sources</p><ol><li>Bruce, Thomas R., and Diane I.

While metadata is valuable for means of description and access in all information systems, it can also be very convoluted and lacking integration as there are numerous metadata standards that often overlap in their intentions to better organize and structure the data systems and objects that they represent. One of the most common and prevalent metadata schemas due to its ease of use, is Dublin Core. This schema is popular and recognized as user-friendly because of its standardized vocabulary language which only includes fifteen elements. However, this ease of use does not make it unsusceptible to issues and long-term drawbacks to its greater utilization in organization of metadata. As Pomerantz describes in the text, <em>Metadata</em>, the elements in Dublin Core are made to be as “unambiguous as possible” which corresponds to, as he states, “[the] subtleties of meaning are flattened out”. This perspective in turn inspires us to ask the questions: 1) what we are losing through this schema and 2)  how does that impact our data?  Ironically, it can also be said, that in essence, the strength of this schema also carries its weaknesses. The significance of these questions is a common issue and great challenge for all metadata standards, as the dream of standardization being universally implemented across all domains may very well be impossible to achieve. However, by looking at this issue through the lens of the utilization of one standard, and in turn contrasting that analysis to another, users can identify how and when certain standards are needed and why the distinction between them is ultimately useful depending upon the subject material being recorded.</p><p>The necessity of metadata is only growing in our current technological age. As the advancement and dissemination of information further becomes an inherent and necessary right in modern societies, it is integral that we maintain systems that can promote the longevity of items, objects, artifacts, documents, images, and histories for the interminable future. Thus, the need for standardization of metadata is an ever-growing field as scholars continue to search for tactics that best incorporate information for future users from both a back and front-end perspective. In its conception, Dublin Core originated to describe and recognize varying items from both digital to physical resources. Today, this schema can be utilized for simple resource description to combining metadata vocabularies of different metadata standards. Further, Dublin Core can provide metadata interoperability for other vocabularies in both linked data cloud and Semantic Web applications. (“Metadata Basics”) This schema is built on the utilization of fifteen standardized elements in its description of data. As taken from the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative website, these include ‘contributor, coverage, creator, date, description, format, identifier, language, publisher, relation, rights, source, subject, title, and type’. These areas are the foundational elements for this descriptive metadata schema.</p><p>Having established what the Dublin Core schema is, it is necessary to investigate the first argument of Pomerantz’s original statement regarding how the semantics being shared across domains is one of this standard’s inherent strengths. This can be recognized through the lens of the simplification of data and material sources. In this regard, it would be important to acknowledge that the purpose of metadata and the systems and infrastructures for preserving data is to make an object, item, and so forth accessible for the future. Naturally, one way to ensure that something (object, item, etc.) is accessible is to make it more simplistic. This position is something Dublin Core abides by, through having less categories and rules around the description of an object the standard can enhance the user’s comprehension when approaching objects and implementing this standard. At length, this foundation is precisely where Dublin Core’s strengths prevail: through the process of establishing a limited vocabulary for the utilization of the standard, the barrier to entry is lower. This allows the standard to be user-friendly for both current and future users of an object, item, etc. for years to come as it is both consistent and more easily able to be classified and read for future analysis and investigation. (Ball)</p><p>Now, regarding the latter perspective that Pomerantz expressed in their initial statement, it is important to acknowledge that the simplification that is at the root of the Dublin Core schema is also its greatest weakness. While Dublin Core is valuable for promoting user accessibility, the negative cornerstone to that is the cost that comes from simplifying things down to a smaller pool of options. Here, the simplification results in the loss of material information and resources due to the minimizing of certain elements and options. Further, it is very possible to misinterpret data through this schema because the need to categorize in a specific way could create user confusion due to the limited categories that may not feel accurately applicable depending on what they are trying to describe. As stated in “Dublin Core: An Obituary”, this “loss of specificity that occurs makes it difficult to then convert it into other systems or to transfer other data from different systems.” (Beall) Beyond this sentiment, one could argue that metadata should be flexible to account for the various objects and artifacts it will come to be utilized for, and thus, through implementing a rigid system such as Dublin Core, we are losing space for broader identities and classifications. Therefore, it is easy to envision how this weakness in Dublin Core could potentially lead to difficulties with both retrieval and interoperability between standards.   </p><p>Through further investigation of these constraints presented in Dublin Core, it is necessary to endeavor to foresee a disaster scenario due to the weaknesses found in this metadata schema. As this standard only allows for fifteen elements, more obscure and articulate information is at risk for long term obsoletion due to these potentially restricting standards. Take for example if a museum were needing to create a Dublin Core record for a photograph, due to the elements being so generalized we could in turn create a record that is inherently unspecific. Due to this, the prospect of losing data about the photograph is one potential disaster scenario. Beyond this, a second issue stems from the lack of consistency that could exist within a record, which, unfortunately, could revert the preservation efforts of this archived photograph null.</p><p>While the weaknesses in Dublin Core are prominent and should necessarily be considered, the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) has already begun to foresee a progressive future in this schema. According to the DCMI, the current focus at the organization is furthering the implementation of linked open data and the role that Dublin Core will enact in this future. With this initiative, the goal is to connect data from a variety of open sources—including libraries, health organizations, and government data—by utilizing this common standard. The hope through this process of establishing linked open data, is to develop the semantic web to where all data is both linked and easily analyzed by computers. The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative believes that through implementing Dublin Core metadata in conjunction with web content that a business or website can then become a part of the semantic web. At length, the data that is being stored in the semantic web is only increasing with the progression of time due to the rapid developments in cloud computing. Therefore, the implementation of a standardized metadata schema will allow further maintenance of this data and create ease of accessibility for all.</p><p>After examining Dublin Core, it is useful to compare it with another schema to analyze what other metadata practices can offer for long term preservation, description, and access. While Dublin Core can be utilized in various areas for resource management, certain other standards can prove just as (if not more) useful depending on the circumstances of what is being standardized. As an example, regarding the management of literature metadata, Dublin Core in conjunction with TEI are the two standards that are most implemented in this subject area, which in turn makes them a natural comparison as each provides effective tools in the formation and standardization of metadata. The Text Encoding Initiative, or TEI, was designed for marking up humanities documents and focuses on structure using coding. Further, it can be customized to include any variation of metadata. This ease of use is what has garnered TEI the reputation as a popular standard, and, as stated from the Introduction to the TEI Guidelines, “[it] provide[s] a means of making explicit certain features of a text in such a way as to aid the processing of that text by computer software running on different machines. This process of making explicit we call markup or encoding.” In comparing the two standards, TEI and Dublin Core overlap in their respective intentions towards accessibility. However, TEI is constructed with more flexibility than what is found in Dublin Core due to its limited set of fifteen elements. In TEI, the following, broader elements must be followed, which include “common core identifiers, and textual features are easily shared and accessible; easy modification features for additions and removals, multiple textual encodings of the same textual resource should be possible, mark-ups should be user defined, following certain small requirements, and the sufficient need for documentation to be written alongside what is encoding.” These features are the core module for TEI and highlight the differences in flexibility and fluidity it presents as a metadata standard in comparison to the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative.  </p><p>TEI offers useful benefits for users as a metadata standard. As the TEI website states, the first strength TEI offers is that it is easily verifiable via an online checked validator which establishes ease of use for all current and future users of this system and enhances accessibility. In addition, TEI is sustainable and open source and is regularly updated. The schema also supports text analyses efforts and adheres to a common standard that can operate on a variety of systems. Further it addresses the problem of varying texts in being designed to be adaptable to these different texts. These factors allow the initiative to be continuously progressive rather than stagnant and abiding by a predetermined catalyst which makes it vulnerable to becoming outdated and insufficient for future user needs in the face of  the rapid ascension of technology in the current day and age. In comparison to this perspective, TEI does, as all standards inevitably do, come with its’ own inherent disadvantages. In this case, these weaknesses include: 1) the process of encoding can be time-consuming due to the efforts of marking up documents. Additionally, 2) the way documents can be marked up also has the potential to be inconsistent as these markups are dependent on the contributor, and thus could make descriptions different not only across but also within varying projects.</p><p>Drawing from these weaknesses, it is important to imagine what a potential disaster scenario could encompass due to the flaws in this specific standard. As discussed, the inherent likelihood of experiencing inconsistencies so easily within the process of this standard is a major issue as fluctuations and differences could lead to long-standing difficulties. However, while TEI can substantiate these differences, it can also, through creating well-formed XML documents, be easily validated against standard TEI schema which allows modifications to be correctly documented across platforms quite easily due to the use of software and online validator. In essence, while any metadata standard would inherently possess its own positives and negatives, and although the barrier to entry for the user to interface with TEI is greater than that of Dublin Core, the positives in TEI inherently solve the negatives. Further, the weaknesses present in Dublin Core are more significant, as the threat of loss of specific information that exists in Dublin Core is something TEI is wholly qualified and designed to prevent. In the end, TEI utilizes expansive space to encourage proper description for long term accessibility needs that can be implemented as successful digital preservation efforts at museums, libraries, and other archival institutions.</p><p>As we’ve discussed<strong>, </strong>all metadata standards are susceptible to the loss of information. However, TEI does prioritize the improvement of its guidelines in the future to address these concerns. In a study conducted on TEI’s user base, it was discovered that while TEI addresses many of the needs for its users, there are some areas and users that TEI does not address properly and these individuals’ concerns are now being recognized and acknowledged for the improvement of the standard in whole. In “The Present and Future of the TEI Community for Manuscript Encoding” the authors address how it appears that the issue most users addressed was the amount of effort it took to simply use TEI, due to the technicalities inherent in the standard such as TEI schemas and further personalization and customization that is available. In the article, it is hypothesized that this issue could initiate from the directions in the guidelines provided on the use of TEI rather than the negatives of TEI itself. However, it is still critical to have these concerns addressed properly for the further ease of description and accessibility for all. Further, it appears some drawbacks come from the specificity utilized in the schema and the desire for more permissible guidelines that allow users to better handle uncertainties. In turn, the Text Encoding Initiative through the configuration of a broad and diverse range of scholars’ efforts is reconfiguring its priorities to strengthen the guidelines to address these grievances within the standard in the hopes of implementing long-term solutions in the future of this initiative. (Burghart and Rehbein)</p><p>At length, both Dublin Core and TEI offer simplistic and useful ways to organize resource materials into metadata schemas which in turn is necessary for further preservation, description, and access. The foundation of this comparison between standards stems from the notion of Dublin Core’s inherent strengths and weaknesses as acknowledged in Pomerantz’s original statement. However, after thoroughly comparing the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative to TEI, it is made clear that despite its weaknesses the standard will remain for its ease of entry and implementation as a metadata standard. While Pomerantz’s argument was right to be addressed as standards should be critically and conscientiously analyzed rather than accepted as they are, wholly unchangeable and immutable. Yet, this challenge and analysis is vital and necessary for greater understanding, development, and continuous improvement and most keenly a representation of the evolution inherent in our current world. As our technologic and preservation needs progress with the influx of data and the necessity for long term accessibility, the potential loss of information only increases, which is in turn why these systems must be reexamined to ensure longevity. Although Dublin Core does in fact permit for a level of flattening out of information that could very well continue to occur, the long-term positives outweigh the arguable negatives that are inherent in this metadata standard. In the end, both Dublin Core and TEI offer positive and negative aspects and these must be acknowledged and accepted before the utilization of one over another on any given classification that could arise in the future.</p><p class="align-center">Sources</p><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Malu Arreguin | UCLA | maluarreguin@g.ucla.edu</p><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><img style="border-width: 0;" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png" alt="Creative Commons License"></a><br>This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://maluarreguin.github.io/mlisportfolio/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://maluarreguin.github.io/mlisportfolio/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
