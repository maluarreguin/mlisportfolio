To some extent, it was due to personal goals, as I always envisioned myself attending graduate school and possessing a graduate degree. In addition, I come from an extended family who mostly possess graduate degrees and felt the need to be on the same level as my cousins, aunts, and uncles. Lastly, while I adored getting my bachelors in English literature, I did not quite know where to go with only that degree. I didn’t see myself as a writer in any corporate sense, and beyond that, I spent my time in undergrad frolicking really, and never thought too far beyond my small world of reading Victorian literature and contemporary poetry and writing extensive, argumentative papers on these topics. I lived a very silly life at UC Berkeley, having transferred after spending four years at community college beforehand, and I was just happy to see myself do anything different at this point in my life while feeling stupidly lucky to be able to have that privilege in that community. I felt both certain and uncertain of myself constantly, chalking things up to “I was going to become whatever I was going to become.” This isn’t a bad way to live, but it doesn’t sound promising when you try to explain that concept to others. Thus, I had instilled the need to revert to graduate school to keep me afloat in the eyes of the world.</p><p>Having graduated with my degree in English, I initially planned to get my Masters in either English or Creative Writing. In my first round of applications, I only applied to overtly competitive programs that were far, far away from my hometown. I did not get in to any and while at the time it felt like a loss, this was all unfolding in March of 2020, to which I now see as such a blessing in disguise. Thus, in the midst Fall 2020, I set my sights elsewhere for my graduate education, as I am originally from Orange County and decided I did not want to be too far from my hometown given these unforeseen circumstances. Having always carried a love of libraries but in conjunction an interest in electronic literature and poetry that I discovered in undergrad, I felt the realm of Library and Information Science sounded very intriguing and applied to the MLIS program at UCLA. In time, I found myself interested in the technology aspect of the humanities, and so I opted to do my concentration as a mash-up of sorts between Informatics and Archives, specifically in the digital sphere, as well as working towards the Digital Humanities Graduate Certificate UCLA offers as well.</p><p>After enrolling in Introduction to Programming and Data Management in my first quarter, I decided to follow this path further and enrolled in a separate Data Management course as well as Digital Preservation. For the Spring quarter I enrolled in Metadata and Human Computer Interaction to further my comprehension in these areas. As it stands, my desire to deepen my understanding of the digital humanities through information technologies is on the forefront of my efforts at UCLA. For my last quarter in the program, I feel as though I’ve created a course schedule that blends the heart of my concentration into one, between Informatics, Digital Asset Management, and Archival Description and Access.</p><p>Throughout the years I have harnessed the valuable skill of being able to work autonomously and further developed my aptitude to pay close attention to detail in my work. As an undergraduate student studying English at UC Berkeley, the duties of reading and examining texts to write and edit papers became my routine, further allowing me to engage in the necessary skills of responsible time management and intelligent direct communication. I have been able to utilize these skills in numerous settings over the years from my time spent as a staff member for the Berkeley Fiction Review to my internship with a global non-profit the summer following my graduation. As a Store Manager I utilized my organizational marketing skills, attention to detail, and leadership to maintain the business’s operations effectively.</p><p>During my time in the program, I have worked as a Graduate Student Assistant for UCLA Capital Programs whose responsibilities include organizing and processing internal documents for digital archiving and database management. This position helped me solidify my desire to engage in digital preservation in its various forms. Concurrently, I have also been working for the UCLA Division of Graduate Education as a Graduate Career Outcomes Project Assistant with responsibilities including conducting alumni research and providing further database management in support of various initiatives across UCLA. Within this position I have been able to hone in my skillsets with multiple software’s including Microsoft Excel for data organization, as well as Tableau and Flourish for creating data visualizations. From the latter half of 2022 I interned with San Diego State University as a Wikidata Project Research Assistant, helping the Cataloging and Metadata Strategies Librarian at SDSU in building faculty profiles on Wikidata. Through this project we were able to create queries using SPARQL to better extend our efforts regarding the projects desire for establishing linked data. As of the Spring of 2023 I have begun working as an Archival Intern with the American Film Institute where, within their Louis B. Mayer Library, I have been processing and organizing archival collections in digital environments and been able to deliberately work with their digital asset management system. At AFI, I can contribute to both cataloguing and creating metadata for these digital assets within this position. My hope upon completing the program is to work in the areas of either digital preservation or data management as I have discovered throughout my masters’ how valuable information equity and accessibility is, and further the ability to capitalize on the digital platforms and software we now have today to better assist in these culminating efforts.</p><p>I joined this program to give myself guidance that I once did not have and I am happy to say this program has pulled me in very specific directions and has allowed me to build a solid foundation for myself and my future career. I have been able to experiment in multiple areas of the library and information science sphere and now feel a strong connection to this world that I am excited to continue forth. Further, I am appreciative that I have been able to work in real world environments within the program to expand my career development efforts and am happy to say I have gained several prominent mentors through my various internship and workplace supervisors throughout this program as well.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Malu Arreguin | UCLA | maluarreguin@g.ucla.edu</p><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><img style="border-width: 0;" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png" alt="Creative Commons License"></a><br>This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://maluarreguin.github.io/mlisportfolio/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://maluarreguin.github.io/mlisportfolio/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
