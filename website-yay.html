This website was created by me, <strong>Malu Arreguin</strong>,<strong> </strong>and is the culmination of my time in graduate school. This site stands as my Digital Portfolio and was created in partial fufillment of the requirements for the Master of Library and Information Science, submitted to the Department of Information Studies as part of the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, at the University of California, Los Angeles for Spring 2023. Here you will find my issue statement and paper, the courses and courework I took throughout the program, my professional development statement, my resume, and a list of my advising history while enrolled in the program. Thank you!</p><p class="align-center"><strong>Accesibility Statement</strong></p><p>This Digital Portfolio was designed intentionally to be as accessible as possible for all users. As an information professional, the need for equity of information lies at the forefront of decision making. Throughout my time in the program, I have learned the significance of usable design practices to allow ease of access for all. This includes those of varying abled bodies as well as those who could lack adequate tools to view this digital portfolio in the primary format it was designed. Thus, I chose to adhere to the overtly recognized Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1, which provide a comprehensive set of standards for digital accessibility. To adhere to these accommodations, this website has been deliberately designed to abide by the following aspects—arrangement, downloadable file formats, and concise design features. Regarding arrangement, my website has organized each section of the portfolio accordingly in the top bar section featured on each page of this website. This arrangement follows a natural path and incorporates submenus to ensure ease for users. Further, each section possesses a downloadable PDF version of that page’s content, placed at the top of each page to ensure ease of findability. Each PDF opens as a separate tab as well, allowing users to not be displaced from their original path. Finally, this website was designed to be readable and accessible above all else. This means black text in a readable font against a white a background can be found on each page, with the picture of UCLA used as the featured image of the site showcasing the menu bar with white text against the light blue background of the sky, but nonetheless, this remains readable to the average user. A downloadable version of this Digital Portfolio can be found by clicking on the file link directly below.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Malu Arreguin | UCLA | maluarreguin@g.ucla.edu</p><p><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"><img style="border-width: 0;" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/88x31.png" alt="Creative Commons License"></a><br>This work is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://maluarreguin.github.io/mlisportfolio/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://maluarreguin.github.io/mlisportfolio/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
